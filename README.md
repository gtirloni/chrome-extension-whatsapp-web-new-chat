# WhatApp Web New Chat

A common issue with WhatsApp is that you have to add the contact before opening a new chat.

It's possible to work around this by asking WhatsApp Web client to send a message to a specific phone number.

This extension asks the user for a phone number and opens the web client URL. That's it.
